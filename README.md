## scoreKeeper
Code along to create a simple counter in vanilla JS with buttons for player 1, player 2, reset. 
Default number of games is 5, but this can be adjusted using the dropdown box. When either player's 
score hits the end number, the counter is frozen, and the winner's value turns green. 
Pressing reset resets scores. Changing the value of number of rounds also causes a reset.
