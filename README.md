## scoreKeeper
Jul 2018  web developer bootcamp udemy course JS code-along

Create a simple game counter in vanilla JS with buttons for player 1, player 2, reset. 
Default number of games is 5, but this can be adjusted using the dropdown box. When either player's 
score hits the end number, the counter is frozen, and the winner's value turns green. 
Pressing reset resets scores. Changing the value of number of rounds also causes a reset.

## colorGame

Create a game where the user is given a RGB value and has to guess from a given set of displayed colors which is correct. Two levels are available, easy (3 choices) or hard (6 choices). User has the choice to reset the colors/play again.

Created six blocks, first assigned colors, then added in randomized.
User selects a block. Color is compared to selected color. If it is wrong, the color is blacked out to background color, and user tries again.
If the blocks are the same, the winner is declared, and all tiles and the navbar background change to selected color.
